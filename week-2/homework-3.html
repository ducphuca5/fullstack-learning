    <h1>A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer</h1>
    <div>
      Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering"
        >software engineer</a
      >
      named Alex. Every day, Alex embarked on a journey filled with coding
      adventures,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">bugs</a> to conquer,
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a> to fuel the
      mind.
    </div>

    />

    <div>
      One fine morning, Alex sat down at the computer, ready to tackle the day's
      tasks. <span class="bigger-text">But alas</span>! The code refused to
      compile, and the bugs seemed to multiply like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit">rabbits</a> in a magic hat.
      With a sigh, Alex dove deep into the code, armed with determination and a
      trusty stack overflow.
    </div>

    />
    <div>
      As lunchtime approached, Alex emerged from the coding abyss, victorious!
      The bugs were squashed, and the code ran smoother than a buttered-up
      slide. But just as Alex reached for the celebratory pizza, an urgent email
      arrived: "<span class="bigger-text"
        ><a href="h1://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug"
          >Emergency bug</a
        ></span
      >
      fix required! <span class="pink-text">Code meltdown</span> imminent!"
    </div>
    <div>
      With a <span class="pink-text bold-text">heavy heart</span> and a rumbling
      stomach, Alex returned to the battlefield. The hours ticked by, but so did
      the lines of code. With each keystroke, Alex grew stronger, wiser, and
      slightly more caffeinated.
    </div>
    <div>
      Finally, as the clock struck midnight,
      <span class="pink-text bigger-text">victory was declared</span>! The bug
      was banished, the code was pristine, and Alex emerged from the coding
      cave, triumphant once more. With weary eyes and a satisfied grin, Alex
      closed the laptop and bid farewell to another day in the life of a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering"
        >software engineer</a
      >
      .
